Varioscale systems perform sample preparation essential to state-of-the-art failure analysis (FA), circuit edit (CE), reverse engineering (RE), as well as other verification and validation (V&V) methods including X-ray tomography, solid immersion lens (SIL) optical probing, and radiation hardness testing. Varioscale is a successful provider of sponsored research to develop integrated laboratory solutions for large scale, rapid imaging of integrated circuits (IC). On-going research combines advanced sample preparation with multi-beam scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-performance computing (HPC) to generate structure information (e.g. GDSII) from integrated circuit down to the 10 nm node. Varioscale has added in-situ measurement of silicon thickness to gallium focused ion beam (FIB) enabling accurate backside gas assisted chemical etching for circuit edit.",agman@varioscale.com,305Z4,50,073,ZQM3ENNJ2PF8,,,1231,,USA,DE,04/30/2024,Branch,7320,760-761-0070,VARIOSCALE,https://www.varioscale.com,2004,CP,,,333310,,,"1782 LA COSTA MEADOWS DR, SUITE 101, SAN MARCOS, CA 92078-9102",92078
